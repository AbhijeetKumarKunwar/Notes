what is system design ?
Systems design is the use of computer engineering principles to build large scale distributed systems. 
It involves converting business problems and requirements into technical solutions. Senior engineers use system design patterns to make reliable, scalable 
and maintainable systems.

System design involves creating both a High-Level Design (HLD), which is like a roadmap showing the overall plan, and a Low-Level Design (LLD),
which is a detailed guide for programmers on how to build each part. It ensures a well-organized and smoothly functioning project. 
High-Level Design and Low-Level Design are the two main aspects of System Design.

Factory Design Pattern(creational design patter-where object is created):-

A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but
let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
